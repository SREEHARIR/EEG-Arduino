# EEG Arduino

This is a program for working with the TI ADS129x series of analog to digital converter chips. 

The TI ADS1298 is a 24-bit, 8-channel ADC chip with SPI interface, and 12x programmable gain amplifiers, meant for ECG and EEG. There are other TI products in the ADS129x range as well.

The hardware is built using gold plated electrodes for good conduction attached to adjustable velcro strapped head cap. The connections are to be made according to the [TI Documentation](https://www.ti.com/product/ADS1298#tech-docs)
